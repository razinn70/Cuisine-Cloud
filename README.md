# Cuisine Cloud: A Production-Scale Social Recipe Platform

![Cuisine Cloud Banner](https://placehold.co/1200x300.png?text=Cuisine%20Cloud)

**Cuisine Cloud** is a comprehensive, scalable, and feature-rich social recipe platform designed to demonstrate senior-level engineering principles. This project is built using a microservices architecture and incorporates advanced features like real-time engagement, machine learning-powered recommendations, and a production-grade infrastructure setup.

## Core Features

-   **Recipe Discovery:** Browse, search, and filter thousands of recipes with advanced search capabilities powered by Elasticsearch.
-   **Recipe Management:** Create, edit, and share detailed recipes, including ingredients, nutritional information, steps, and media (images/videos).
-   **Social Engagement:** Follow users, like and comment on recipes, and participate in a real-time activity feed.
-   **Smart Meal Planning:** Plan weekly meals, generate intelligent grocery lists, and get recipe suggestions based on your dietary needs and available ingredients.
-   **AI-Powered Tools:**
    -   **Smart Recipe Tool:** Get AI-powered suggestions for recipe modifications or substitutions.
    -   **AI Recipe Generation:** Generate brand-new recipes from a list of ingredients.
    -   **Computer Vision:** (Planned) Analyze food images for ingredient recognition.
-   **Progressive Web App (PWA):** A fully responsive, installable, and offline-capable mobile experience.

## System Architecture

Cuisine Cloud is built on a distributed, microservices-based architecture designed for scalability, resilience, and maintainability.

-   **Frontend:** A modern, server-rendered application built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**.
-   **Backend:** A collection of independent microservices built with **Node.js** and **TypeScript**.
-   **API Gateway:** A single entry point for all client requests, handling routing, rate limiting, and authentication.
-   **Databases:**
    -   **PostgreSQL:** Primary relational database for core services.
    -   **Redis:** In-memory cache for high-performance data access and message queuing.
    -   **Elasticsearch:** Powers the advanced search and discovery engine.
-   **Infrastructure:** The entire system is containerized with **Docker** and orchestrated with **Kubernetes**, with infrastructure managed via **Terraform**.
-   **Observability:** Monitored with a stack including **Prometheus** for metrics, **Grafana** for dashboards, and **Jaeger** for distributed tracing.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Docker & Docker Compose
-   Node.js (v18+)
-   An `.env` file populated with the necessary Firebase credentials (see `.env.example`).

### Running Locally

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/cuisine-cloud.git
    cd cuisine-cloud
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Populate .env with your Firebase project configuration
    ```

3.  **Start the application stack:**
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4.  **Access the application:**
    -   **Frontend:** `http://localhost:3000`
    -   **API Gateway:** `http://localhost:4000`
    -   **Grafana Dashboard:** `http://localhost:3001`
